Description

StarLion is a tool (written in Java) for visualizing RDF ontologies. It
can load ontologies expressed in .rdfs files or stored at the FORTH-ICS
Semantic Web Knowledge Middleware (for more see
http://athena.ics.forth.gr:9090/SWKM/).
Distinctive characteristics of StarLion include:
(a) the provision of Top-k diagrams  for aiding the process of 
understanding an ontology,
(b) configurable force-directed layout algorithms,
(c) support of a semi-automatic layout process (where the user can change
node positions, nail down nodes, apply layout algorithms, etc).

StarLion can load more than one namespaces (the dependencies of an
ontology) and supports multiples frames and visualization views.
